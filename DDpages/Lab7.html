<h1> Murder Hornets Section </h1>

<p> Starting out 2020 we were welcomed with this atrocious looking insect called the murder hornets. Around January through March the Murder Hornets were all over the U.S and it was making people worry for their safety.</p>

  <h1> California Wildfire </h1>

<p> And just as we thought 2020 couldnt get worse the autralian wilfires started happening and this affected over millions of wildlife animals. Many firefighters and other people all over the world came to help these wildlife animals with water & food. The animals werent just soley affected by food and water but they no longer had a home to come back to. People from California were now fleeing the area to be able to feel safe and secure.</p>

  <h1> Death of George Floyd </h1>

  <p> The death of George Floyd aroused so much tension between citizens/residents of the U.S and the government and the rules they have for police enforcement.This issue does not seem to have a finish line any time soon. People want the Justice that George Floyds family deserved. Racism seems to be the polices go to response when encountering a black/darkskin person. Black people fear for their lives when coming in contact with the police, not because they have done anything illegal but because of the Racism that is embeded in this society to the point where some ignorant people see it as normal.</p>

  <h1> Covid-19 </h1>
  <img alt = "Corona Virus" src= "https://www.fda.gov/files/covid19-1600x900.jpg" height= "200" Width="300">
  <p> Corona Virus arrival had the whole world in panic and in awe. Lockdown began in around February and the world has not been the same since. We can definitely say CoronaVirus has definitely impacted the world the most economically, physically, and mentally. There are still a lot of people who refuse to take the Corona Virus seriously(Republicans) They believe it was made so that the government is able to track us easier. They are being ignorant and refuse to wear a mask. They would rather die than be helping out the economy. I believe we would have been out of quarantine a long time ago if these people would just obey the rules and care for the saftey of others. Comparing this issue to other countires the U.S is doing far worse because Americans keep wanting to go out without caring for the consequences. They dont follow the rules of wearing a mask or social distancing and are putting other peoples lives in risk.</p>
