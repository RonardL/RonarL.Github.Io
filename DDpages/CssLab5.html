<p>I'm hearing all the alarms ring-a-ling
They go off every time that we're face to face
Why is it so hard to resist?
Temptation sweet as honey, I know it's too late
I feel it deep inside, I'm gonna lose the fight
Eventually I know that I'll be crossing the line
I try warning myself, 'cause I'm in need of help
Can't hold me back, already standing right at the edge
Out of control (Hey) </p> <br><br><br><br><br><br>
  <p>Oh I've been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave in to the dark side calling to me
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah, hey)
You pull mе over to the red, rеd, red line
I can't escape it, you're my weakness and you're my vice
In the shadows, you're the only highlight
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah)</p>
  <br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>You're my forbidden fruit (Ya ya)
Pretend that there's no rules (Ah ah)
I'm turning all the lights off tonight
And spiraling into the abyss, losing myself (Yeah, yeah)
There ain't no turning back
Addicted to the feeling like I'm caught in a trance (In a trance)
It's like you flip a switch, your power over me (Hey)
Is limitless and now all I can do is give in
Out of control (Ooh, yeah; Hey) </p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>Risky, risky, why you test me?
This is an emergency
Help me, help me, somebody stop me
'Cause I know I can't stop me
Getting closer and closer
When I know I'm in danger
Need to get away from ya
You're like the devil on my shoulder
What's going on inside? (Ah, ah)
There's a war I'm trying to fight (Ooh, ooh)
Since it opened my eyes
I can't stop me, can't stop me, can't stop me (Oh)</p>
