	<h1> This is the Visual Design Page</h1>
<p> In this tab I will be showing different kinds of art I have done in my visual design class.</p>
<img src="RL kaleidoscope 1.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/>
<p> Artist Statement: Originally my chosen image was a thanksgiving meal. Show-casing different kinds of foods. The reason that I chose that image was because I felt like it could be a challenge to try changing the image into a way that is not recognizable. I chose to make the image darker because to begin with the image was already pretty bright. By making it have a darker contrast it adds questions to what was the image showing. My process of making my image into a kaleidoscope was pretty quick. After messing around with the filters I had to cut the image where its in the middle, then I copy and pasted the image that was cut an reflected all throughout the page This is how I came up with the Kaleidoscope. </p><br>
<img src="Mandala2.2.png" Width="300" height="300" alt="Mandala">
<p> Artist Statement:This art style is called the Mandala. The original design was a tree. After duplicating the tree multiple times and changing the color of it, I was able to make it into a spiral shape.I chose the specific shape of a tree because I felt like it would have been a chellenge to make it a spiral. There was not a lot of editing that went on. After choosing the color that I wanted I scaled the image and even rotated the image so it can get the spiral shape. Overall this was a fun thing to try and would recommend others to try it aswell.</p>
<img src="San.png" width="350" height="230" alt=""/>
<p> Artist statement: This art style is called Pop Art Gradient. The original design was of a man named San who is also in a boy-group named Ateez.I have done 2 other works with the similar art style, however I chose this one because it was my most favorite one. I feel like the colors chosen best go with the over all image. The colors that I chose dont have an overall significance to them, however they did come out very nicely.There was a small proccess that went through in order to make this. First choosing the image that you want.Then cropping out the background.Change the brightness and contrast up to 100, and make layers of your image. Then you changethe Hue and saturation and the colors will begin to change.  </p>
