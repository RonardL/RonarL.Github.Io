<p> In this tab I will be showing different kinds of art I have done in my visual design class.</p>
<img src="RL kaleidoscope 1.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/>
<p> Artist Statement: Originally my chosen image was a thanksgiving meal. Show-casing different kinds of foods. The reason that I chose that image was because I felt like it could be a challenge to try changing the image into a way that is not recognizable. I chose to make the image darker because to begin with the image was already pretty bright. By making it have a darker contrast it adds questions to what was the image showing. My process of making my image into a kaleidoscope was pretty quick. After messing around with the filters I had to cut the image where its in the middle, then I copy and pasted the image that was cut an reflected all throughout the page This is how I came up with the Kaleidoscope. </p>
